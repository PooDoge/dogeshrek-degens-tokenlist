## How to Submit your Token

Create a commit in ./tokens/addresses creating a folder with your token's Dogechain contract address, in it containing your token's **transparent** background **logo.png** no larger than **100x100px**! It's required that your token has at least some liquidity on Dogeshrek and that the project's main liquidity is **locked** for a reasonable period of time.

New tokens will be added on a weekly basis as long as the project has a **safe** contract with its code **verified** on [Dogechain Explorer](https://explorer.dogechain.dog). For faster consideration leave a link to your project's Telegram group or your admin's Telegram handle in the commit description. To expedite the process you may join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/DogeshrekChat) and let us know you made a commit with your logo.
